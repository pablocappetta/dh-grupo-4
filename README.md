  <summary>:octocat: Félix</summary>
  <br/>
  Well, hey there! I'm a 22 years old psychology student, thinking about the idea of getting into academia or pursuing a tech career. Mediocre musician, professional progressive rock listener. The real embodiment of a Jack of all trades, but master of none!

## What we aim to do 📌

We aim to <strong>create a website intended for music producers around the world</strong> to improve the quality of their work by using libraries created by other musicians.

As music lovers, we know for sure that <strong>imagination has no limits</strong>. With <strong>Musify</strong>, you'll be able to both share and use samples as you wish.

You can find more information here: https://musify-dh.herokuapp.com/.

## Reference sites 📃

Well...we're beginners, right? We've discussed and we <strong>really</strong> like the elements that below sites provide.

- <strong>https://patreon.com/</strong> @ The header, the main. Patreon does a fantastic job providing a modern and fresh UI. Our goal is to replicate/achieve something similar for our page.

- <strong>https://theproducerkit.com/</strong> @ The simplicity of this page is what we do like. Everything is pretty much on the main page.

- <strong>https://www.loopcloud.com/cloud/</strong> @ The absolute winner for us. This page captures the UI mindset the four of us have. We're stunned by the way it's designed and our goal is to build something really similar.
