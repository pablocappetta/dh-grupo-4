              You don't have to worry about peaks and lo-fi instruments. Our
              system automatically filters out unwanted noise generated by
              not-so-well compressed files. AI, ladies and gentlemen!

              Producers will be able to select which samples they want to make
              available to try. And, yes, they can choose as much as they want.

              You can search for whatever you need: voice samples, drum kits,
              guitar loops. You call it. Tag any kit or sample you need and you
              can buy it individually. Cool, huh?
