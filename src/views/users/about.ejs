          We are a group of four Digital House students that agree that music is
          the weapon. Musify is a project that came up after noticing the
          passion for programming and different sounds. All our source code can
          be found
          <a href="https://github.com/pablocappetta/grupo_4_musify">here</a>.

              You don't have to worry about peaks and lo-fi instruments. Our
              system automatically filters out unwanted noise generated by
              not-so-well compressed files. AI, ladies and gentlemen!

              Producers will be able to select which samples they want to make
              available to try. And, yes, they can choose as much as they want.
              We gotcha', pal!

              You can search for whatever you need: voice samples, drum kits,
              guitar loops. You call it. Tag any kit or sample you need and you
              can buy it individually. Cool, huh?
